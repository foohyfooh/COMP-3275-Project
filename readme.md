# COMP 3275 Project - Alert System
SMS based Alert System 

This project consists of two parts:
- A server that receives SMS messages from the clients and keeps a record of the phone numbers of those who wish to subscribe to the alerts. The server also broadcasts SMS messages to all subscribed clients at the time of an emergency.
- A  client that gives the ability to subscribe and unsubscribe from alert messages from the server.
